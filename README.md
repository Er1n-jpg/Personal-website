# Personal-website
hey guys! For the athena award I made a personal website, it looks really crusty dusty and musty but it was pretty much my very first experience within web development aside from a scrapyard chrome extension project. 

This website includes a small unfinished blog area, AN EVEN MORE UNFINISHED PROJECT BAR and an about me section which includes a ton of my interests and hobbies. 

I learned alot about css in this project and ill aim to make this "temporary" website into a more functional one in the future :D

For now this is a pretty silly temporary submission for athena IGNORE THE WACKYNESS
