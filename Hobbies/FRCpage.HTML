        <h1> FRC</h1>
        <p> I started FRC (first robotics competition) back in the 9th grade quite literally because I thought the hoodie looked cool :) Obviously we’ve gone a suuuuper long way from there, over the years i’ve made my way up as a pretty key component of the team as well as being 9127’s technician for 2025 and being one of their dean’s list semi finalists. This year im starting my 3rd year of FRC in (probably) team 7476!
