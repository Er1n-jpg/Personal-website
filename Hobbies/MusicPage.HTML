        <h1> Music</h1>
        <p>My journey with music started like basically every other asian child, with an RCM piano lesson. I started playing piano at the ripe old age of 5 and basically played it up until I was in the 6th grade. However, contrary to popular belief, I used to HATE piano. I hated the keys, I hated music, I hated the fact I had to sit down for literal hours and do theory so I quit on the chance I could. However something changed when I stepped into the mandatory grade 8 music class. It felt weirdly refreshing seeing music in a new light and i’ve been in concert band ever since then! This year im in senior band :D </p>
