        <h1> Art</h1>
        <p>I’ve been doing art since pretty much the start of time. When I was younger I was sooo convinced I would grow up leaning towards an art related major. I’ve been seriously drawing since I was in 5th grade and have, for the most part, self taught! I’ve since been drawing less because I started building an interest with STEM but I still occasionally pick up the pencil and paper (or tablet) and start drawing!  Here are some of my illustrations (for hackathon related stuff and not for hackathon related stuff!)</p>
