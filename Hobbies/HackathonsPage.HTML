            <p> Something I accidentally roped myself into because I missed the bus. One day after a AV job I came out a bit too late to catch the bus so I went to  the upper foyer to wait for the next one. While waiting I saw a few of my friends at a table talking, being the annoying kid I am, I walked up to that table and bam I was organizing JPEG. Since then I’ve been up to organizing a few more hackathons such as Daydream Ottawa and camelCase. </p>
