       <p>This is something I literally picked up on a whim because I decided it would be funny to sign up as a joke back in grade 9. Imagine my surprise when I got an acception email thrown in my inbox a few days later. Since then i’ve helped with various volunteer and paid jobs and even had the chance to participate in my school’s musical back in 2024!</p>
